# deinfinitis

This is a testing site for an online scholarly edition of the loose treatise on infinite series "De Infinitis" by the 17th century mathematician Thomas Harriot. This project is also a use-case for an NEH-AHRC-funded initiative to define an interoperable text framework (ITF). Our efforts to innovate with user-experience in non-linear text-navigation will inform the specifications of the ITF.
