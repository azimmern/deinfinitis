<h1>De infinitis. De continuo.</h1>

<p>Aristotle in the beginning of his 6th booke of his physicks, & in the</p> |

 <p>26th text of the 5th booke, defineth those thinges to be continua</p> |

<p>quorum extrema sunt unum. in the 22th texte of the said 5th booke</p> |

<p>that tangentia sunt quorum extrema sunt simul. Simul, quae in</p> |

<p>uno loco sunt primo. Separatim quae sunt in altero. </p>||

<p> Now for the &lt;better explication&gt; (~~understanding)~~ of the &lt;meaning of the&gt; definitions as also of there truth. Let us</p>|

<p>vnderstand first two &lt;materiall&gt; cubes A & B to be separate, that is, to be in diuerse</p> |

<p>places, extremes & all.||</p>
